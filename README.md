# ElementSplitter
Script which allows to split elements by levels. There are two options of additional settings:
  -Split by all levels existing in the project or split by levels visible in current view. WARNING second option is not so stable, make sure you have visible levels which are assigned to top and base of the elements when splitting
  -Grouping splitted elements. Grouping includes all newly created elements
Currentelty avaliable elements to split are: Structural Columns, Slanted Strcutural Columns, Walls, Ducts and Pipes. 
Script should work in versions of revit 2018-2021.

#### Right now I'm working on splitting Conduits and CableTrays - stay updated!
